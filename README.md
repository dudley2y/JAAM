# JAAM

This was a program created by Joshua Dudley, Al Bondad, and Michael Hu.

This was done at the Stevenson Highschool Hackathon over a period of 24 hours from March 2-3, 2019.

The topic of the Hackathon was Data Privacy

Our intended product was to create a virtual credit card to protect people's online card information, recognizing that "fishing" or creating false websits to gain access to people's cards are becoming more common.

We figured out that we could create valid card numbers that would work on some companies (such amzazon). However we later learned that this wouldn't be viable because we could never associate money with the card, so the products we tried buying from amaon would cancel shippment due to no money going through. 

However, despite never finishing the product, all of us learned a great deal about web extensions, databases, bootstrap, credit card algorithms, banking, money transactions and many other valuable information.
